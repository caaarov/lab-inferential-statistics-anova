After the next lesson, we will ask you to solve this problem using Python. Here are the steps that you would need to work on: - Null hypothesis - Alternate hypothesis - Level of significance - Test statistic - P-value - F table\n",

    "Suppose you are working as an analyst in a microprocessor chip manufacturing plant. You have been given the task of analyzing a plasma etching process with respect to changing Power (in Watts) of the plasma beam. Data was collected and provided to you to conduct statistical analysis and check if changing the power of the plasma beam has any effect on the etching rate by the machine. You will conduct ANOVA and check if there is any difference in the mean etching rate for different levels of power. You can find the data anova_lab_data.xlsx file in the files_for_lab folder\n",
